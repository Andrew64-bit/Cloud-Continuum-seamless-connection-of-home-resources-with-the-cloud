This Ansible role performs several actions related to disabling swap memory and configuring firewall rules for UFW and Firewalld based on the state of those services on the target system. Here's a breakdown of what each task does:

1. **Remove Swap**:
   - **Task**: Disables all swap spaces immediately.
   - **Command**: `swapoff -a` turns off swap to ensure Kubernetes or other applications don't use swap since it might not be desired or supported (e.g., Kubernetes by default does not support swap).

2. **Populate Service Facts**:
   - **Task**: Gathers facts about all the services on the target machine.
   - **Purpose**: This information is used in subsequent tasks to check the state of specific services (like UFW and Firewalld).

3. **Allow UFW Exceptions** (Conditional):
   - **Condition**: This block of tasks is executed if UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) is running on the target system.
   - Tasks within this block:
     - **Get UFW Status**: Executes the `ufw status` command to check if UFW is active.
     - **Display UFW Status**: Outputs the result of the UFW status command.
     - **If UFW enabled, Open API Port**: Opens a specified API port if UFW is active. This is essential for applications that require specific ports to be accessible.
     - **If UFW enabled, Allow Default CIDRs**: Allows traffic from specified Cluster and Service CIDR ranges. This step is crucial for ensuring that intra-cluster and service-to-service communications are not blocked by the firewall.

4. **Allow Firewalld Exceptions** (Conditional):
   - **Condition**: Similar to the UFW block, but for systems using Firewalld as the firewall management tool.
   - Tasks within this block:
     - **If Firewalld enabled, Open API Port**: Opens the specified API port for incoming TCP traffic, marking it as trusted in Firewalld. This ensures that the necessary API endpoints are reachable.
     - **If Firewalld enabled, Allow Default CIDRs**: Similar to the UFW counterpart, this task allows traffic from specified Cluster and Service CIDR ranges in Firewalld, ensuring open communication channels within the cluster.

Each of these tasks ensures that the target system is configured to support the requirements of applications that might be sensitive to swap usage or need specific firewall configurations to operate correctly. The role dynamically adapts to the firewall system present on the target, applying the necessary rules based on the system's configuration.
